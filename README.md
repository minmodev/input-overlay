## sending keys to another PC

*(e.g. from gaming PC to streaming PC)*

1. run the `input-overlay-ws` server on your **gaming PC** and enable the HTTP server in its settings
2. find your gaming PC's local IP, run `ipconfig` in cmd and copy the IPv4 address (usually `192.168.X.X`)
3. click **`open in browser`** inside the HTTP server settings
4. enter the gaming PC's address in both the **input-overlay-ws** field and the hosted **configurator**
5. click **`⎘ copy url`** to copy the hosted overlay url and add it as a browser source in OBS on the streaming PC
